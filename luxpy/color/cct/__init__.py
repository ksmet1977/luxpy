cct: Module with functions related to correlated color temperature calculations
===============================================================================
 These methods supersede earlier methods in cct_legacy.y (prior to Nov 2021)

 :_CCT_MAX: (= 1e11 K), max. value that does not cause overflow problems.

                 temperature calculations. 

 :_CCT_LUT: Dict with pre-calculated LUTs with structure LUT[mode][cspace][cieobs][lut i].
 
 :_CCT_LUT_CALC: Boolean determining whether to force LUT calculation, even if
                 the LUT.pkl files can be found in ./data/cctluts/.
 
 :_CCT_LUT_RESOLUTION_REDUCTION_FACTOR: number of subdivisions when performing
                                        a cascading lut calculation to zoom-in 
                                        progressively on the CCT (until a certain 
                                        tolerance is met)
                 
 :_CCT_CSPACE: default chromaticity space to calculate CCT and Duv in.
 
 :_CCT_CSPACE_KWARGS: nested dict with cspace parameters for forward and backward modes. 
 
 :get_tcs4(): Get an ndarray of Tc's obtained from a list or tuple of tc4 4-vectors.
 
 :calculate_lut(): Function that calculates the LUT for the input ccts.
 
 :generate_luts(): Generate a number of luts and store them in a nested dictionary.
                    (Structure: lut[cspace][cieobs][lut type])
