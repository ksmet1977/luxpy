  :luxpy._CMF: 
      | Dict with keys 'types' and x
      | x are dicts with keys 'bar', 'K', 'M'
      |
      | * luxpy._CMF['types']  = ['1931_2','1964_10',
      |                           '2006_2','2006_10','2015_2','2015_10',
      |                           '1931_2_judd1951','1931_2_juddvos1978',
      |                           '1951_20_scotopic']
      | * luxpy._CMF[x]['bar'] = numpy array with CMFs for type x 
      |                          between 360 nm and 830 nm (has shape: (4,471))
      | * luxpy._CMF[x]['K']   = Constant converting Watt to lumen for CMF type x.
      | * luxpy._CMF[x]['M']   = XYZ to LMS conversion matrix for CMF type x.
      |                          Matrix is numpy array with shape: (3,3)
      | * luxpy._CMF[x]['N']   = XYZ to RGB conversion matrix for CMF type x.
      |                          Matrix is numpy array with shape: (3,3)
                            
     Notes:
         
        1. All CMF functions are extrapolated using the CIE recommended method 
            to a full 360-830 range. See luxpy.cie_interp for more info on the default
            extrapolation method used.

        2. There is no XYZ to LMS conversion matrices defined for the 
            1931 2° Judd corrected (1951) cmf sets.
            The Hunt-Pointer-Estevez conversion matrix of the 1931 2° is 
            therefore used as an approximation!
            
        3. The XYZ to LMS conversion matrix M for the Judd-Vos XYZ CMFs is the one
            that converts to the 1979 Smith-Pokorny cone fundamentals.
            
        4. The XYZ to LMS conversion matrix for the 1964 10° XYZ CMFs is set
            to the one of the CIE 2006 10° cone fundamentals, as not matrix has
            been officially defined for this CMF set.
            
        4. The K lm to Watt conversion factors for the Judd and Judd-Vos cmf 
            sets have been set to 683.002 lm/W (same as for standard 1931 2°).
            
        5. The 1951 scoptopic V' function has been replicated in the 3 
            xbar, ybar, zbar columns to obtain a data format similar to the 
            photopic color matching functions. 
            This way V' can be called in exactly the same way as other V 
            functions can be called from the X,Y,Z cmf sets. 
            The K value has been set to 1700.06 lm/W and the conversion matrix 
            has been filled with NaN's.
            
        6. The '2015_x' (with x = 2 or 10) are the same XYZ-CMFs as stored in '2006_x'.
        
        7. _CMF[x]['M'] for x equal to '2006_2' (='2015_2') or '2006_10' (='2015_10') is NOT 
            normalized to illuminant E! These are the original matrices 
            as defined by [1] & [2].
            
        8. _CMF[x]['N'] stores known or calculated conversion matrices from
            xyz to rgb. If not available, N has been filled with NaNs.
