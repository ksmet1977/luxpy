    :luxpy._CMF: 
      | Dict with keys 'types' and x
      | x are dicts with keys 'bar', 'K', 'M'
      |
      | * luxpy._CMF['types']  = ['1931_2','1964_10',
      |                           '2006_2','2006_10','2015_2','2015_10',
      |                           '1931_2_judd1951','1931_2_juddvos1978',
      |                           '1951_20_scotopic']
      | * luxpy._CMF[x]['bar'] = numpy array with CMFs for type x 
      |                          between 360 nm and 830 nm (has shape: (4,471))
      | * luxpy._CMF[x]['K']   = Constant converting Watt to lumen for CMF type x.
      | * luxpy._CMF[x]['M']   = XYZ to LMS conversion matrix for CMF type x.
      |                          Matrix is numpy array with shape: (3,3)
      | * luxpy._CMF[x]['N']   = XYZ to RGB conversion matrix for CMF type x.
      |                          Matrix is numpy array with shape: (3,3)
                            
     Notes:
         
        1. All functions have been expanded (when necessary) using zeros to a 
            full 360-830 range. This way those wavelengths do not contribute 
            in the calculation, AND are not extrapolated using the closest 
            known value, as per CIE recommendation.

        2. There is no XYZ to LMS conversion matrices defined for the 
            1931 2° Judd corrected (1951) cmf sets.
            The Hunt-Pointer-Estevez conversion matrix of the 1931 2° is 
            therefore used as an approximation!
            
        3. The XYZ to LMS conversion matrix M for the Judd-Vos XYZ CMFs is the one
            that converts to the 1979 Smith-Pokorny cone fundamentals.
            
        4. The XYZ to LMS conversion matrix for the 1964 10° XYZ CMFs is set
            to the one of the CIE 2006 10° cone fundamentals, as not matrix has
            been officially defined for this CMF set.
            
        4. The K lm to Watt conversion factors for the Judd and Judd-Vos cmf 
            sets have been set to 683.002 lm/W (same as for standard 1931 2°).
            
        5. The 1951 scoptopic V' function has been replicated in the 3 
            xbar, ybar, zbar columns to obtain a data format similar to the 
            photopic color matching functions. 
            This way V' can be called in exactly the same way as other V 
            functions can be called from the X,Y,Z cmf sets. 
            The K value has been set to 1700.06 lm/W and the conversion matrix 
            has been filled with NaN's.
            
        6. The '2015_x' (with x = 2 or 10) are the same XYZ-CMFs as stored in '2006_x'.
        
        7. _CMF[x]['M'] for x equal to '2006_2' (='2015_2') or '2006_10' (='2015_10') is NOT 
            normalized to illuminant E! These are the original matrices 
            as defined by [1] & [2].
            
        8. _CMF[x]['N'] stores known or calculated conversion matrices from
            xyz to rgb. If not available, N has been filled with NaNs.
