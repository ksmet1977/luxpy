Notes:
1.
All functions have been expanded using zeros to a full 360-830 range. 
This way those wavelengths do not contribute in the calculation, AND are not extrapolated using the closest known value as per CIE recommendation.

2.
The 1951 scoptopic V' function has been replicated in the 3 xbar, ybar, zbar columns to obtain a data format similar to the photopic
color matching functions. This way V' can be called in exactly the same way as other V functions can be called from the X,Y,Z cmf sets.
